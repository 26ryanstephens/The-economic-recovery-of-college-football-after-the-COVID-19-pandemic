        <p>College football, like many other industries, has faced significant economic challenges as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic forced the cancellation of entire seasons, disrupted schedules, and left stadiums empty, leading to a loss of revenue for the sport and universities across the country.</p>
        
        <p>Prior to the pandemic, the 2019-2020 season saw the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) make nearly $9.1B across the board in total revenue. However, restrictions across the board for the 2020-2021 season saw the FBS only make around $7.3B, nearly a $2B reduction because of the pandemic.</p>

        <p>With economic hits occuring from so many sectors of the FBS economy, colleges football programs across the country worried about the damages that the pandemic could bring and the overall longevity of the sport.</p>

        <p>However, the economic effects of the pandemic were short lived, and the 2021-2022 season saw its numbers return back to the mean, with little to no effects lingering from the pandemic the year prior.</p>

</script>

        <p>Not only did the 2022 season see college football's economy return back to normal, it reached the highest total revenue the sport has ever seen. When trying to find reasons as to why the sport saw so much growth prior the sports most economically challenging year of all time, there are a few areas to turn to.</p>

        <h2>Ticket Sales</h2>
        
        <p>Ticket sales played an influential role when returning back to normality for the 2022 college football season.</p>
        
        <p>Not only are ticket sales important for filling the stands and making the games more enjoyable, but they are a quintessential force that drives the economy of not just college football, but sports in general. Without fans in the stands, the FBS was at a signfiicant loss of revenue for their 2021 season.</p>

        <p>Although some conferences and areas across the country allowed for a limited number of fans to attend games, many conferences did not permit any. Conferences like the Big Ten and Pacific 12 were hit worse economically compared to the Southeastern and Big 12 conferences, because of their more strict regulations on allowing fans to enter the games.</p>

        <iframe title="FBS Athletic Conferences Ticket Sales" aria-label="Bullet Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-ASfsQ" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ASfsQ/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="396" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
</script>

        <p>Ticket sales across the board plummetted for the 2021 season, but it is no surprise that they were back up as soon as restrictions were lifted. With season ticket holders itching to get back at the stadiums and college students being brought back onto campuses, ticket sale values were bound to increase ddrastically for the 2022 season.</p>

        <p>It is important to note that a lack of ticket sales was not the only thing holding back the economy of the 2021 college football season. Although it was one of the biggest revenue losses submitted by the Knight Newhouse Report, other expenses proved to be detrimental as well.

        <h2>Medical</h2>

        <p>Medical expenses were an uncharted territory that the FBS did not have to deal with prior to the COVID-19 Pandemic. Sure, every college football program has their fair share of medical expenses; however expenses during 2021 cut into the economic revenue of the FBS, and cost these institutions a lot more money than they had ever anticipated.</p>

        <p>The pandemic created a medical emergency that no one could have prepared for. According to Michelle Hedges, a nurse during the pandemic at Hunterdon Medical Center in Flemington New Jersey, saw her hospital get flipped upside down with money and resources being thrown COVID-19's way. </p>

        <p>For example, Hedges highlighted that tests were being ordered rapidly, space was created for more admitted patients, and funding was immediately going towards creating a vaccine. These were all expenses and spending that had not been needed in previous years, but were becoming more prevalent during 2020 and into 2021. </p>
        
        <p>Football saw a very similar shift with their spending and The Power Five conferences of college football took exception to an increase in medical spending. The Southeastern and Big 12 conferences nearly doubled their amounts allocated for COVID-19 medical spending, while every conference saw a pretty sginficant increase.</p>

        <iframe title="FBS Athletic Conferences Medical Expenses" aria-label="Bullet Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-lFVu2" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/lFVu2/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="352" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
</script>

        <p>Medical expenses across the country proved to be pretty significant for college football no matter the area. Whether a school was located more south with looser COVID-19 restrictions (like the Southeastern or Big 12 conferences), or in more COVID-19 restricted areas (like the Big Ten, Atalnatic Coast, and Pacific 12 conferences), there seemed to be a pretty balanced approach with certain conferences allocating the money neccessary to cover medical expenses for the pandemic.</p>

        <p>Similarly, recruiting expenses for the 2021 season followed a similar trend to that of medical expenses, in which the region or conference did not really effect the money schools decided to utilize to scout players. </p>

        <h2>Recruiting</h2>

        <p>Recruiting expenses took a pretty signfiicant hit for the 2021 season of college football, but once again soon returned back to normal going into the 2022 season. For college football programs, this is one expense that wants to be at a hiher price. Programs want to utilize more funding as a way to recruit better players to come to their programs. </p>

        <p>The bigger conferences tend to allocate more funding to their recruiting programs as a way to land some of the top prospects of their recrutiing classes. However, the pandemic put a pretty large restriction on the ability to do this. </p>

        <p>With travel restricitions in place and social distancing in place, top conferences and programs were unable to fly out recruits, spend in person time with them, and ultiimately recruit them at the elite level they are used to competiting at. </p>

        <iframe title="FBS Athletic Conferences Recruiting Expenses" aria-label="Bullet Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-rPZpo" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/rPZpo/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="396" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
</script>

        <p>The recruiting fiasco during COVID-19 created a little bit of parody among college football's conferences. The smaller conferences (group of five conferences) were able to recruit at a very similar level to that of the larger conferences (power five conferences), creating a slightly more equal playing field and allowing better recruits to trickle down to the smaller programs.</p>

        <p>As seen in the data however, this equal playing field of 2021 has since been diminished, like much of the other data that has been seen. The larger conferences are back to making high levels of money and spending the amounts they need to stay relevant in the ever growing world of collleg football.</p>

        <h2>Overall</h2>

        <p>

        <p>The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on college football's financial stability, but the sport has proven to be resilient. Despite the unprecedented challenges, college football has quickly bounced back economically and sees no signs of slowing down in the near future. </p>

        <P>It is unknown whether another medical emergency will break out like the COVID-19 pandemic, but there is now a gauge, and a little bit of reassurance to know that college football's economy will most likely go back to normal.</P>
